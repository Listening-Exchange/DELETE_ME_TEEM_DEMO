depending on type (scalar vs enum vs other-via-callbacks). Old code has long had nested
switch statements: first for option kind, and then for option type. Fresh scrutiny of
this code revealed how, now that there is no more airStrtok/airStrntok action because all
individual args have been saved into per-option arg vectors, the parsing problem is just
to get a single value, and, how to get a single value can be made entirely uniform across
type; via the _hestParseSingle[] array. All the info needed here is just the hestOpt
(and `parseMop`, `enm`, and `CB` fields within it), and the `err` msg buffer that is
used to describe any parsing error, not just via hestCB.  */
