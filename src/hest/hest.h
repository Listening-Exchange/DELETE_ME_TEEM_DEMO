 * The airType values are here in hest as a transition hack for TeemV2. The parsing needs
 * of hest are what motivated creating airTypes in the first place. The fresh perspective
 * of TeemV2 recognizes they should have been in hest from the outset, not in air.
 *
 * The blissfully-type-unaware hestOptAdd() has always relied on the airTypeT enum values
 * below. Since that function is not being removed, to avoid needless code breakage with
 * TeemV2, these values now live in this hest header. However, hest users should instead
 * be using one of the 99 properly typed hestOptAdd_X_T functions from adder.c (see
 * below), which have no need for airType pseudo-types.
 *
 * Other things that used to be in air, but which really only mattered to implement hest
 * functions have been moved into privateHest.h, but with air --> _hest renaming:
 *    #define AIR_TYPE_MAX
 *    const char airTypeStr[AIR_TYPE_MAX + 1][AIR_STRLEN_SMALL + 1];
 *    const size_t airTypeSize[AIR_TYPE_MAX + 1];
 *    unsigned int (*const airParseStr[AIR_TYPE_MAX + 1])(void *, const char *,const char

The hestArg, hestArgVec, hestInput, and hestInputStack were all created for the 2025
TeemV2 rewrite of hestParse, to fix bugs and limits on how the code previously worked:
- Command-line arguments containing spaces were fully never correctly handled: the
  internal representation of one argument, as one space-delineated substring of all
  the arguments concatenated back into a single string (a bad idea), was never correctly
  implemented. Now the internal representation of argv is with an array data structure,
  not a single string that has to be retokenized. The old code was wary of dynamic
  reallocation as part of the parsing process, the new code embraces it (note the many
  airArray).
- When parsing response files, ""-quoted strings were not correctly handled (nor was "#"
  appearing within a string), and response files could not invoke other response files.
- Can now support long-wanted feature: commenting out of some span of arguments, with
  new hest-specific "-{" "}-" delimiters.  As long as these are space-separated from
  other args, these are left intact by sh, bash, and zsh (csh and tcsh get confused).
  They must be kept as separate args to avoid brace expansion.

/* The 99 (!) non-var-args alternatives to hestOptAdd, enable more type checking because
they non-var-args, but are also usefully type-specific for each possible type of value to
be parsed in a way that hestOptAdd_nva cannot match. In fact, *all* possible ways of
using hest are covered here, due to the enumeration over "kind" and over type T, which
determines the function name as follows:

kind  min, max             function family         description
 1    min == max == 0      hestOptAdd_Flag         (stand-alone flag; no parameters)
 2    min == max == 1      hestOptAdd_1_T          single fixed parameter
 3    min == max >= 2      hestOptAdd_{2,3,4,N}_T  multiple fixed parameters
 4    min == 0; max == 1   hestOptAdd_1v_T         single variadic parameter
 5    min < max; max >= 2  hestOptAdd_Nv_T         multiple variadic parameters

The type T can be (one for each airType enum value): Bool, Short, UShort, Int, UInt,
Long, ULong, Size_t, Float, Double, Char, String, Enum, or Other. An `airEnum *enm` is
passed with the T=Enum functions. A `hestCB *CB` is passed for the T=Other functions. The
number of parms `int *sawP` that hestParm saw on the command-line is passed for the _Nv_
options.

For each of the 14 different `_T` types, there are 7 different families for `_1`
(kind=2), `_2`,`_3`,`_4`,`_N` (kind=3),`_1v` (kind=4), and `_Nv` (kind=5).
14 * 7 = 98, plus hestOptAdd_Flag makes 99 functions.

All declarations below were automatically generated via hest/test/decls (which calls
hestOptAddDeclsPrint), followed by clang-format. */
