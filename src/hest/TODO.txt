How is it that, once the command-line has been parsed, there isn't an
easy way to see (or print, for an error message) the parameter (or
concatenation of parameters) that was passed for a given option?
Want to be able to have error messages like "you passed %s to the -i
option but that has a problem: ..."
Should add a new output field in hestOpt, alongside "source",
to store this new single string.

for super long things like "tend glyph", it would be nice to have
seperator lines between the long versions of options, to visually
group them somewhat.

currently the "input nrrd" option to unu comes last as a way of allowing
hest to do error checking on all other (more error prone) options.  But
it would be nice to indicate a parsing order seperate from the option order.

The kind of option is independent of whether is flagged or unflagged,
optional (default given) or mandatory (no default given).

??? What is relationship between parseHest.c/whichCase() and hestOpt.alloc ???
