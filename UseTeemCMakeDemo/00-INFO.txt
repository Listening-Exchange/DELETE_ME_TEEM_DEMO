This is a simple demo of how another C program can use CMake to link
with a CMake-built Teem (it also reflects how I (GLK) am belatedly
understanding how CMake works).

Steps:

1) Set TEEM_DIR to the path to where CMake installed Teem.  There should be
`bin`, `include`, `lib`, subdirectories, and the `lib/cmake` will record how
CMake built Teem.  Then:

  ls $TEEM_DIR

should show `bin`, `include`, `lib`.

2) The following will create a `localbuild` subdirectory right here where
testio.c is, doing the configure and generate steps of CMake:

  cmake -S . -B buildhere \
     -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$TEEM_DIR \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=installhere

The `.` argument to `cmake -S` is the path to the source directory, and the
`buildhere` argument to `cmake -B` is the path of the to-be-created directory
to will contain all of CMake's work and files for building this
"DemoOfUsingTeem" project (named by the `project(DemoOfUsingTeem LANGUAGES C)`
line in CMakeLists.txt).  After the `find_package` in ./CMakeLists.txt runs,
CMake will set its own `Teem_DIR` variable to $TEEM_DIR. The `installhere` path
is where CMake will install things in when asked to install.

3) To build in a way that is agnostic w.r.t. build system:

  cmake --build buildhere

which means: run the "build" step (first "--build") in the `buildhere`
directory.  Or if you like running make directly:

  (cd buildhere; make)

4) To install:

  cmake --install buildhere

which runs CMake's "install" process on whatever has been built in "buildhere"
