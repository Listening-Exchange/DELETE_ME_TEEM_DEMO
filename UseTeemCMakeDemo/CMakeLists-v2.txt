# Shows how to use CMake to make an executable that depends on Teem

# Actually this version requirement may be needlessly high; an earlier
# CMake version may also work; probably anything above 3.0
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

# Set (demo) project name, initialize compiler detection and compiler flags
project(TestNrrdIO LANGUAGES C)

# Find Teem (must be installed in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or default system paths)
find_package(Teem REQUIRED)

# Associate one executable testio with project
add_executable(testio testio.c)

# Link testio against the imported target, which brings in include paths and
# transitive dependencies automatically
target_link_libraries(testio PRIVATE Teem::Teem)

# Install the testio binary into ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin
install(TARGETS testio
